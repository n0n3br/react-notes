# React Notes

React Notes is a sample [React](https://reactjs.org/) app built to store user notes in browser's localstorage.

For css I used [react-bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/). 

All the tests are written using [jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [react-testing-library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro)
